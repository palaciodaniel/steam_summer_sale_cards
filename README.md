# Steam's Summer Sale 2020 - Sold Trading Cards

Approximately every six months, the immensely popular gaming platform [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) celebrates these massive sale events, where not only it is possible to buy games at a massive discount, but also it represents an excellent opportunity to sell Trading Cards to increase your account balance and be able to expand your collection with even more titles.

For those people who do not play games, what are the Steam's Trading Cards? They simply are virtual items that you automatically get on your profile after playing certain games during a couple of hours. Although some people decide to collect them, others instead prefer to sell them on the [Steam's Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/) to get virtual credit that you can use to buy more games, as already expressed above.

An interesting aspect of these transactions is that in specific occasions you can buy certain games and sell their cards in a way that not only you recover the money spent on purchasing the game, but also you can even get an additional margin profit!

However, this is not as simple as it seems. It will require a lot of discipline and judgement, and above all a lot of organization, because you have to remember the prices for every single card and adjust them accordingly, so that you are able to sell them at a reasonable price.

In this sense, a spreadsheet becomes incredibly helpful to keep a record of all the Trading Cards you have sold so far, and also to plan the next steps to sell the remaining ones in a way that benefits you. With these objectives in mind I created a spreadsheet for the situation, that you can quickly consult [on the following link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wk9T-VuOcup3vXDjzZVZGmcSBZln6MbMGEs5X9TYHDY/edit?usp=sharing).

It must be noted that as of the moment of writing these lines GitHub does not support spreadsheets, therefore the only way to view it is through the link I already provided. Still, it was a pragmatic decision to create a small repository for it, so that users are able to understand and explore all my projects in a single place without unnecessary complications.
